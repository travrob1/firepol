# My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

## To run server:
`node .`

## One time setup stuff

### To install mongodb:
  Install brew  http://brew.sh/
  Do this as a user with admin rights.  As root fails and is hard to
  cleanup because of permissions problems.

`brew install mongodb`

### To setup the mongodb (after its installed):
`mongo`
```
> use firepol
> db.createUser( { user: "firepol", pwd: "firepol", roles: [ "readWrite", "dbAdmin"] })
```

## Zero time setup stuff
(it's already done and persisted in git, so you don't have to.)
`slc loopback` start project
`slc loopback:datasource` create a datasource
`slc loopback:model` create a model 
`slc loopback:relation` create a relation
